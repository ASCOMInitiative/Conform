6.4.64.0
Version 6.4.64.0 - This version requires Platform 6.4
  All - The performance results message has been revised to leave it to driver authors to decide acceptable performance rates for their driver and hardware.
  Camera - Improved memory management when cameras return large image arrays
  Dome - Issues are now reported when CanXXX properties return true but the associated XXX methods throw exceptions.
  ObservingConditions - Improve Observing Condition Hub action pass-through tests
  SafetyMonitor - Bug fix: Driver now passes when it is connected and returns IsSafe = true.
  Telescope - Bug fix: Telescope.TargetRightAscensionRate and Telescope.TargetDeclinationRate tests will now accept COM InvalidOperationExceptions as valid responses.
  Telescope - Improve logging when enumerating the TrackingRates object
  Telescope - Telescope.TrackingRate Set has additional tests for conditions that the driver should reject with an InvalidValueException.
            1) Setting a value lower than the smallest DriveRates enum value
            2) Setting a value higher than its largest DriveRates enum value

Version 6.4.63.0 - This version requires Platform 6.4
  Telescope - Bug fix: Revise the Telescope.DestinationSideOfPier test to use an "above the horizon" target when the site is in the southern hemisphere. 
              This fixes the issue that Conform caused some drivers to return PierSide.Unknown in the Telescope.DestinationSideOfPier test.

Version 6.4.62.0 - This version requires Platform 6.4
  All - Change all HTTP references to HTTPS
  All - Spelling corrections applied to application and comments
  Focuser - Added tests to make sure that absolute focusers can reach positions 0 and MaxStep
  Focuser - Added tests to make sure that absolute focusers gracefully fail when commanded outside their supported position range
  Telescope - Confirm that Slewing is False when RightAScensionRate and DeclinationRate are non-zero 
  Telescope - Confirm that SlewToCoordinates, SlewToCoordinatesAsync and SyncToCoordinates set the TargetRightAScension and TargetDeclination properties
  ObservingConditions - Add extended SupportedActions / Action tests specifically for aggregated drivers presented by the Observing Conditions Hub

Version 6.4.61.0 - This version requires Platform 6.4
  Camera - New Conform configuration options to override the camera supplied MaxBinX and MaxBinY values
  Camera - Camera.PercentCompleted is now tested as having an optional implementation, in line with the published specification
  Camera - Revised exception handling for some properties and improved messaging
  Focuser - Move tests revised to match new IFocuserV3 behaviour introduced in Platform 6.4
  ObservingConditions - Added test to confirm that Wind direction is reported as 0.0 when wind speed is reported as 0.0
  Telescope - New configuration setting that will log a message before every driver call to aid debugging
  Telescope - TargetRightAscension - Messages now report the target RA rather than the RA that the telescope actually reported
  Telescope - Add check that no exception is thrown when calling AxisRates.Dispose
  Telescope - Add check that no exception is thrown when calling Rate.Dispose
  Telescope - Add check that no exception is thrown when calling TrackingRates.Dispose
  Switch - The range of switch numbers that will be searched for valid switches is now configurable through the Options/Conformance Options menu
  Switch - New configuration setting that will log a message before every driver call to aid debugging
