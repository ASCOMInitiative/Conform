6.0.0.45
Version 6.0.0.45
Rotator     Rotator.Halt was incorrectly expecting a PropertyNotImplementedException, it now checks for MethodNotImplementedException
Camera      Allow for BinX and BinY to throw InvalidValueExceptions within the range 1 to MaxBin if these bin values are not supported.

Version 6.0.0.44 - This version of Conform requires Platform 6
Telescope   Allow for possibilty that TargetRA and TargetDEC may throw not implemented exceptions when testing SlewToTarget
Telescope   Allow for possibilty that TargetRA and TargetDEC may throw not implemented exceptions when testing SyncToTarget

Version 6.0.0.43 - This version of Conform requires Platform 6

All - Added test for System.InvalidOperationException, now provides message advising to use ASCOM.InvalidOperationException
All - Removed infintie loop bug in releasing .NET in-process drivers
Telescope - Added support for ServoCAT.Telescope invlaid value COM exception number
Telescope - Added extra debug information for SyncToCoordinates and SyncToTarget
Telescope - AxisRates: Improved testing of enumerator methods and associated debug diagnostics
Telescope - Corrected MoveAxis test names in Conform display
Telescope - TrackingRates: Improved debug level diagnostic messages

Version 6.0.0.38 - This version of Conform requires Platform 6

All - Added tests for Platform 5 and Platform 6 interfaces
All - Now uses DriverAccess to access devices
All - Can now configure Conform to run as 32bit on a 64bit OS 
All - Moved the Debug option to the "General" options tab
All - Will now report non-string types returned in the SupportedActions ArrayList as errors
All - The "first time" safety warning message has been updated to encompass all device types not just
      telescope
All - Conform no longer attempts to interpret state from the returned error message. The original behaviour
      can be enabled through a configuration option. See version 3.0.0.15 description
Camera - Added test for description > 68 characters to ensure compatibility with FITS headers
Camera - Fixed bug that could fail LastExposure tests for in-process camera drivers
Camera - Widened tolerance on LastExposure check; within 2% of expected is now OK
Camera - The ASCOM Camera specification was revised to state that StopExposure should not throw an exception
         if there is no exposure is in progress. Conform now tests for this revised behaviour.
Camera - SetCCDTemperature now reports the ability to set temperature outside the range -280C to +100C as
         Issues rather than Errors
FilterWheel - Added pre-run check to ensure the filter wheel is stationary before tests start
Telescope - Added InvalidOperation exception as OK when target declination and target right ascension 
            are read without first having been set
Telescope - Improved diagnostics if TrackingRates is not correctly implemented.
Telescope - Fixed incorrect message when returned RA is out of valid range
Telescope - Added extra test to check whether commands can unpark the scope when they should not.
Telescope - Added test for IsPulseGuiding stuck on
Telescope - Fixed issue in SiderealTime test when PC and scope clocks are close to 00:00:00
Telescope - Moved time check to pre-run checks section
Telescope - Added support for testing Telescope Interface V1 drivers
Telescope - Fixed SyncToAltAz so that it wont try to use Azimuth and Altitude properties if these are not
            implemented
Telescope - Added better reporting if a driver returns a null object for AxisRates(Axis)
Telescope - Failure to retain tracking state after MoveAxis was shown as OK, now shows as an Issue

Version 3.0.0.17

Dome - Fixed exceptions in post test safety checks when Dome.CanPark and Dome.CanSetShutter were False

Version 3.0.0.16

Camera - Fixed bug that flagged all attampts at early binding as errors
Focuser - Fixed acceptance of incorrect exception when moving focuser with temperature compensation active
Focuser - ASCOM.InvalidOperationException is now accepted as OK
Focuser - ASCOM.InvalidValueException is no longer accepted as OK
Installer - Moved to Inno Setup 5.3.7 Unicode

Version 3.0.0.15

Exceptions - Exceptions that use words like "not supported" are accepted as "not implemented" exceptions
Focuser - Now restores the original TempComp value
Focuser - Added delay between successive create attempts to allow previous instances to clean up properly
Focuser - Added missing test that Move should throw an exception when TempComp is set to True
Focuser - Will now accept .NET InvalidValueException thrown by Move when TempComp is true
Telescope - Added test for ablility to set tracking before trying to set it in three places
Telescope - Added skip of SideOfPier tests if SideOfPier can not be read
Startup - Fixed internationalisation issue. Decimal separator of "," caused a startup exception
