<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Conform is a program to test ASCOM driver conformance to the relevant
interface standard. </p>

<p>Its primary users are expected to be driver authors who will be able to
excercise all aspects of their driver without having to write their own test
harnesses. Conform also benefits ASCOM client authors and their customers by
ensuring greater homogeneity in ASCOM standard implementation and thus more
consistent behaviour and hence less client application issues requiring coding
to individual driver behaviour.</p>
