<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Conform provides the capability for driver authors to create a validation
file that others can use to confirm that the supplied driver does achieve a
specified level of conformance to the relevant ASCOM specification. </p>

<h1>Creating a validation file</h1>

<p>Creation of a validation file is effected by clicking on the "Create
Validation File" entry in the "Validation" menu. This does not of itself create
the validation file, it just flags that you want a validation file created each
time you do a conformance check.</p>

<p>Assuming the flag is now set, a conformance check will run completely as
normal except for some extra steps at the end that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a hash checksum for the driver executable that you are testing</li>
  <li>Create the validation file that contains the conformance output including
    the executable checksum</li>
  <li>Creates a checksum for the whole validation file, including the
    executable checksum</li>
  <li>Prepends the validation file checksum to the validation file</li>
  <li>Reports where the validation file has been created</li>
</ul>

<p>The executable can now be packaged into an installer, if this has not
already been done, and sent together with the validation text file to Bob for
inclusion on the driver download page.</p>

<h1>Confirming Validation</h1>

<p>To confirm validation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Obtain the driver installer and the validation text file from the ASCOM
    site</li>
  <li>Install the driver</li>
  <li>Start Conform and select the driver as if you were going to check its
    conformance (you do not need to actually run a conformance check)</li>
  <li>Select "Confirm Current Driver Validation" from the "Validate" menu</li>
  <li>Select the validation text file through the open file dialogue and press
    the "Open" button</li>
</ul>

<p>Conform will then confirm that: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the contents of the validation file have not changed from the point at
    which the driver author created it</li>
  <li>the installed driver name is the same as in the validation file</li>
  <li>the installed executable has the same hash checksum as in the validation
    file</li>
</ul>

<p>and report accordingly.</p>

<h1>Notes</h1>
<ol>
  <li>The validation approach validates the executable not the installer</li>
  <li>Validation does not force any level of compliance on the driver author.
    Conform will create a validation file for a driver regarless of how many
    errors, warnings or issues it generates.</li>
  <li>By validating the driver executable rather than an installer, the
    validation text file only needs to be updated when a driver code change is
    made.</li>
</ol>
